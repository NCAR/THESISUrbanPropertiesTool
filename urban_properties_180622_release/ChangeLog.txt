One-line summary: add avg_landgcells flag (default True) to make backwards compatible with
CLM5 datasets (Oleson and Feddema, 2010)
Changes made:

avg_landgcells is added and set to True by default in urban_prop.csh.  This implements averaging
over 1km LAND gridcells instead of all gridcells to produce the 0.05deg data. This reproduces
the Oleson and Feddema (2010) data (the optional surface dataset) for all fields except for
PCT_URBAN where the max differences there are only
      1.4210854715202e-14
      -1.4210854715202e-14
Set avg_landgcells = False otherwise. This method was implemented in ctsm5.2 mksurfdata_esmf.

One-line summary: add capability for non-binary 1km urban data (PR#1)
Changes made:

This update includes code changes that enable the THESIS tool to use both binary and non-binary
1 km urban data to generate the 0.05 deg urban property data. The urban land cover for three 
density classes are saved as floating numbers instead of integers.  Besides the necessary 
changes to enable non-binary urban input, some large variables when they are no longer needed to optimize memory use.

One-line summary: add hooks to gen_data_clm.ncl
Changes made:

Add commented-out hooks for gen_data_clm.ncl -- as a reference to those who might use it.
A prerequisite for running gen_data_clm.ncl is running CLM's "mksrf" (make surface data sets), 
and the mksrf code is not provide here (it is bundled with the CLM source code).  Hence, 
while the gen_data_clm.ncl code is provide here, it is NOT called from the urban_properties 
driver script (urban_prop.csh)

One-line summary: new gen_data_*.ncl functionality
Changes made:

Notes:
o gen_data.nml is a new "namelist" file used by gen_data_*.ncl code
  The intent was that the following three codes would run in order...
  (1) gen_data_1km.ncl   -- creates urban properties data on a 1km grid
  (2) gen_data_05deg.ncl -- creates urban properties data on a 1/2 degree grid
  (3) gen_data_clm.ncl   -- creates urban properties data suitable for input to CLM
  ...resulting in a CLM input data file -- but it turns out that there is an
  additional code that must be run between steps (2) and (3), code that is not
  practical to include here (rather it comes bundled with the CLM source code)
  Note this final step (3) is very CLM-specific, thus prehaps doesn't belong
  here with more generic urban properties specifications.
  
  Thus this new tag adds the functionality to run steps (1) and (2) but not (3)
  Maybe this will be revisited in future urban properties tags.

M urban_prop.csh
A gen_data_1km.ncl   -- runs first
A gen_data_05deg.ncl -- runs second
A gen_data_clm.ncl   -- runs last, this will NOT be included as it is CLM specific
A gen_data.nml       -- input specification for gen_data_*.ncl

One-line summary: corrections as per Johannes Feddema
Changes made:

M       src/mat_prop.csv  -- tweaks to vol_heat_cap wrt the use of the *average* 
                             density and spec_heat of several similar materials

Version: urban_properties_161130
One-line summary: re-factoring in support of GUI interface
Changes made:

(1) constructing (windows + frames) is now done same process as (walls + bridge)
    thus eliminating the need to merge windows with walls
    thus this step is eliminated:
    unix> gen_surf.ncl < surf_spec_fw > surf_prop_fw.ncl
(2) walls are no longer merged with (windows + frames) via
    unix> gen_surf.ncl < surf_spec_fw > surf_prop_fw.ncl
    rather, they remain separate until they are merged in this step
    unix> gen_city.ncl < city_spec_fw > city_prop_fw.ncl
    which implies that city_spec.csv not only specifies what wall to use,
    but also what window to insert into the wall, and what window fraction to use
(o) together, (1) and (2) mean this code and input data are no longer 
    needed or used: gen_surf_ncl, surf_spec_fw.csv, surf_spec_ww.csv
    and these output files are not created or used as 
    input: surf_prop_fw.csv, surf_prop_ww.csv
    thus simplifying the work flow and making it easier to implement via GUI

This code re-factoring is answer changing, but it is believed this new code is
more accurate -- because there is less i/o of formatted, limited precision data,
and also the re-factored code uses double precision everywhere, whereas the old
code did not.

   Attached are two files.  In order to do the windows I had to add
   a few new walls therefore there are 2 changed files.

o no longer are all layers merged into one layer -- rather 1 to 10 equal-thickness layers 
  of tk & cv are specified and preserved (as 10 layers) thru the whole tool chain.   
o has new road materials (mat_prop.cvs) and road layer specifications (lam_spec.csv)
  as chosen by Johannes Feddema and Keith Oleson

One-line summary: 1st tagged version, validated
Changes made: 

See email "THESIS Urban Properties tool validation" dated 2015 May 22
(Keith Oleson <oleson@ucar.edu>, "Johannes J. Feddema" <feddema@ku.edu>,
Peter Lawrence <lawrence@ucar.edu>) which explains the validation process in detail.  

In short, this code reproduces the output of the original Excel spreadsheet, except that 
it fixes various bugs.  By reintroducing the bugs here (which is not the default) one can 
reproduce the results of the spreadsheet.
